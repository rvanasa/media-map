part of 2016, the hashtag #KanyeWestIsOverParty is trending on social media right now.","the hashtag #KanyeWestIsOverParty is a response to 2016\'s notorious #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty hashtag, and the hashtag #KanyeWestIsOverParty marks the latest chapter in the endless saga of the Taylor Swift vs. Kanye feud.","Because early on Saturday, new footage from the infamous \u201cFamous\u201d phone call between the two stars leaked ,  and it complicates the original story.","Here\'s the background.","Back in February 2016, Kanye released a new song, \u201cFamous,\u201d that featured a controversial lyric: \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.","/ Why?","I made that bitch famous.\u201d that bitch was referencing that bitch scandalous altercation with Taylor in 2009, when Kanye stormed the stage at the MTV VMAs as Taylor accepted an award to announce that it really should have gone to Beyonc\xe9.","In 2009, Taylor Swift was already an enormous star, but Kanye was suggesting in Famous\u201d that it was Taylor Swift doing that Taylor became a household name.","Shortly after the song released, TMZ reported that Kanye had checked with Taylor to make sure Taylor was cool with the lyric before Taylor Swift dropped it, and that Taylor got the joke and gave Taylor Swift Taylor blessing.","But Taylor Swift, through Taylor publicist Tree Paine, denied it.","\u201cKanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release Famous on Taylor Twitter account,\u201d her publicist Tree Paine told the New York Times.","\u201cTaylor declined and cautioned her publicist Tree Paine about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message.\u201d Taylor added, \u201cTaylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, \u2018I made that bitch famous.","\'\u201d\\nKanye, meanwhile, maintained that her publicist Tree Paine definitely had checked with Taylor before her publicist Tree Paine dropped the song.","Several weeks of contentious back-and-forth ensued, culminating when Taylor won Taylor second Album of the Year award at the Grammys and made a highly acclaimed acceptance speech shouting out \u201call the young women out there\u201d who have to deal with \u201cpeople along the way who will try to undercut your success, or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.\u201d It was all but certainly a direct reference to Kanye\'s song.","But then Kanye\'s wife, Kim Kardashian West, changed the story.","In July 2016, Kim posted a series of videos on Snapchat that showed Kanye calling Taylor up to ask for Taylor permission to include a verse referencing Taylor in \u201cFamous.\u201d (Kanye, Kim explained, films Kim all the time for a documentary about Kim life Kim plans to make one day.)","In the videos Kim posted to Snapchat, Kanye clearly reads Taylor the line, \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,\u201d and asks for Taylor approval.","The video is cut together in a way that makes The video unclear that Taylor ever heard the line \u201cI made that bitch famous,\u201d but me and Taylor do discuss whether or not Kanye would have had any way of knowing that Taylor was already famous in 2009, in a way that makes it appear that at the very least, Kim is given Taylor the gist of the line.","Kanye repeatedly says that Kim wants Taylor to be happy with the finished song.","We also hear Taylor respond that Taylor appreciates the thought, that Taylor thinks the lyric is \u201ctongue-in-cheek,\u201d and that the lyric would probably be good for Taylor public image to be able to say that Taylor knew about the finished song ahead of time.","As soon as The video dropped, Taylor haters exploded.","Taylor, Taylor Swift haters declared, was a manipulative, cold-blooded snake and The video proved a manipulative, cold-blooded snake.","#TaylorSwiftIsOverParty trended on social media, and gleeful observers flooded Taylor accounts with snake emojis.","Taylor issued a statement reiterating that Taylor problem with the finished song was the word \u201cbitch,\u201d which Taylor said Kanye never told Taylor about.","\u201cYou do not get to control someone\'s emotional reaction to being called \u2018that bitch\' in front of the whole world,\u201d Taylor wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post.","But Taylor statement did little to calm the frenzy.","As far as the wider internet was concerned, Taylor was canceled.","So Taylor disappeared from public life for a year to wait out the schadenfreude.","Taylor built Taylor next album, 2017\'s Reputation, around the idea that Taylor was \u201ca snake.\u201d And in the recently released Netflix documentary about Taylor life, Miss Americana, Taylor talked about how difficult Taylor found that time to be, as someone who built so much of Taylor self-identity around the idea of being a good person who people would like.","\u201cWhen people decided I was wicked and evil and conniving and not a good person,\u201d Taylor said to Taylor mom, \u201cthat was the one that I could not really bounce back from because my whole life was centered around my whole life.\u201d\\nNearly four years later, the new video appears to complicate the story that Kim Kardashian told everyone in 2016. the new video strongly suggests that Taylor was telling the truth about that phone call ,  but that Kanye was too.","the new video shows both Kanye and Taylor worrying about what \u201cFamous\u201d will do to Kanye and Taylor reputations\\nThe video that Kim dropped back in 2016 was spliced together from different pieces of the infamous conversation, but it appeared to show mostly the end of Kanye\'s phone call with Taylor.","This new footage, which arrived online from an unknown source late Friday night and rapidly spread across social media, is uncut and over 25 minutes long.","KIM K AND Kanye AND THE MOST DESPICABLE, GROSS AND MANIPULATIVE PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY THE MOST DESPICABLE, GROSS AND MANIPULATIVE PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY LIED ABOUT TAYLOR SWIFT IN 2016 AND THIS THREAD OF THE LEAKED PHONE CONVERSATION WILL SHOW YOU THAT.","pic.twitter.com/jCw07z8Vpf ,  , (@redligion) March 21, 2020\\nIn the new footage, Kanye clearly asks Taylor if Taylor would be interested in debuting \u201cFamous\u201d from Taylor Twitter account, just as Taylor maintained back in 2016.","\u201cYou got an army.","You own a country of motherfucking two billion people, basically,\u201d a country of motherfucking two billion people says.","\u201cIf you felt that it is funny and cool and like, hip-hop, and felt like The College Dropout and the artists like \'Ye that you love, then I think that people would be, like, way into it.\u201d a country of motherfucking two billion people suggests that a country of motherfucking two billion people thinks it would be funny and good for Taylor public image for Taylor to be able to say that Taylor knew about the song ahead of time.","Taylor seems puzzled at the idea that it would make sense for Taylor to release the song, and when Kanye opens Kanye pitch by revealing that it contains an \u201cextremely controversial line\u201d about Taylor, Taylor sounds nervous.","\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Taylor asks.","\u201cIs it going to be mean?\u201d\\nKanye goes on to workshop a couple versions of the line that became \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex\u201d with Taylor.","Kanye starts off with \u201cI feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex,\u201d which makes Taylor laugh and say, \u201cWell, that is not mean!\u201d although Taylor notes that the line is \u201cabsolutely crazy.\u201d\\n\u201cI am glad it is not mean, though,\u201d Taylor says.","\u201cThe buildup you gave it, I thought it was going to be, like, \u2018That stupid dumb bitch.","\'\u201d\\nKanye then goes on to offer the possibility of making the line, \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,\u201d noting that Taylor wife prefers the first version.","\u201cThe \u2018owe\' part,\u201d Taylor says, makes Taylor nervous, because of the possibility of \u201csome feminist group type shit.\u201d\\n\u201cthat is the only thing about the line,\u201d Taylor agrees, \u201cIs that the feminists are going to come out.","But I mean, you do not give a fuck, so.\u201d\\nLater, Kanye asks, \u201cWhat if, later in the song, I was to say, \u2018I made Taylor famous?","\'\u201d\\n\u201cit is just kind of like whatever at this point,\u201d Taylor says.","\u201cyou have got to tell the story the way the story happened to you and the way you experienced the story.\u201d\\nOverall, the conversation appears to fit both Kanye\'s and Taylor\'s versions of the story.","Kanye does repeatedly ask Taylor for Taylor approval of the song, and Taylor does tell Kanye Taylor thinks it is funny, just as Kanye said when it first dropped.","And Kanye does ask Taylor to release the song on Taylor Twitter account, and Taylor does warn Kanye that it could spark some feminist criticism, just as Taylor said in Taylor statement back in 2016.","Kanye clearly thinks the controversial part of the lyric is when Kanye suggests that they might have sex, which is what Kanye is concerned about, and Taylor is clearly more worried that Kanye might call Taylor a bitch, which Kanye does not mention Kanye plans to do.","For Taylor fans, though, the video functions as a complete repudiation of the narrative Kanye and Kim established back in 2016. it is now clear, Kanye and Kim maintain, that Kim and Kanye lied about Taylor okaying the line \u201cI made that bitch famous,\u201d that Taylor was in the right all along, and that Taylor\'s 2016 cancellation was just Kanye heaping more undeserved humiliation on Taylor on top of the travesty of 2009.","Hence, it is now Kanye West who should be over.","\u201cMy heart breaks listening to that phone call, the fact that she even picked up the phone and wasted she valuable time to listen to that nincompoop speak is just a testament to how great a human she is,\u201d tweeted Taylor\'s friend and collaborator Todrick Hall.","collaborator Todrick Hall added, \u201cThe sad part is that I am sure there will be no apology from collaborator Todrick Hall or the millions of people who took those gifs of a conversation & trailer of an actual conversation as fact without ever hearing the convo in full.\u201d\\nWhat is perhaps more interesting than the question of which artist is right, however, is that throughout the conversation, both Kanye and Taylor are hyper-aware of how \u201cFamous\u201d will fit into Kanye and Taylor public images.","Kanye complains that people think Kanye is a bully, and Kanye wants to make sure the song does not play into that narrative.","Taylor, who at the time was at peak media saturation following the release of 2014\'s 1989, notes that \u201ceverything that I do becomes a feminist think piece,\u201d and that \u201cright now, I am, like, this close to overexposure.\u201d\\nAnd in the end, that is the reason Taylor cites for refusing to launch the song from Taylor Twitter account: not the idea that it is misogynistic, but because \u201cif I launch the song, honestly, I think it will be less cool.\u201d\\nThus far, none of the parties involved have made a public comment on the new footage."],"sentiment":{"very_positive":0.11679238080978394,"negative":0.34329742193222046,"neutral":0.4207456111907959,"very_negative":0.1191646158695221},"triple_sentiment":{"very_positive":0.10556699335575104,"negative":0.3165096640586853,"neutral":0.5247229337692261,"very_negative":0.0532003678381443},"insult_rating":0.045315985094036976},{"title":"California\'s

Trends","Smart speakers have been the focus of controversy and concern for some time, particularly with regard to privacy rights.","Many people worry Many people smart devices were listening in on conversations even when the activation word had not been spoken ,  and to some extent, those fears were reasonably founded.","After the news leaked that Google sent Google audio recordings to a third party to be transcribed, many people feared many people private lives had been compromised.","the news resulted in people re-evaluating people privacy settings on smart devices, and in some instances, changing the activation phrase to something that might not be so easily triggered.","the news also called into question just how accurate the smart assistants\' listening capabilities were; for example, if you spoke a word that was almost, but not quite the activation phrase.","Would it work?","Digital Trends wanted to find out, so we tested Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Siri to find out which phrases ,  if any ,  triggered the devices.","This is what we found.","Amazon Alexa\\nAmazon\'s Alexa smart assistant gives users four separate options for a wake word: Alexa, Amazon, Echo, and computer.","When \u201cAmazon Alexa\u201d was set as the wake word, the device responded to similar names like \u201cAlexis,\u201d \u201cLexa,\u201d and \u201cLexus.\u201d Other words like \u201cextra\u201d and \u201cketchup\u201d did not trigger \u201cketchup.","Notably, with \u201cAmazon\u201d as the wake word, no words falsely activated the device.","\u201cHexagon,\u201d \u201cBabylon,\u201d and other similar-sounding words gave no response no matter how many times we tested.","Alexa at a glance Wake words Alexa, Amazon, Echo, and computer False activations Gecko, Art deco, Hey puggle and Kuder\\nthe wake word \u201cEcho\u201d responded most easily to false activations.","While other wake words would sometimes trigger for similar sounds, \u201c\u201cEcho\u201d\u201d responded on the first try every time.","the device triggered for \u201cgecko,\u201d and \u201cart deco.\u201d Other phrases like \u201cprosecco,\u201d \u201cGreco,\u201d and \u201cfresco,\u201d did not trigger the device.","Note: the device also responded to, \u201cHey puggle,\u201d in a test for the device.","With \u201ccomputer,\u201d as the wake word, the device did respond to phrases that were similar, but the device is important to note that this did not happen every time except for one phrase: \u201ccommuter.\u201d \u201cEcho\u201d responded to the name \u201cKuder,\u201d but only twice.","Other phrases like \u201csupercomputer,\u201d \u201ccommutator,\u201d and other similar-sounding words did not trigger \u201csupercomputer.","Interestingly, only words that began with a \u201cC\u201d or \u201cK\u201d sound triggered \u201csupercomputer.","Even \u201ccolluder\u201d did not, though \u201csupercomputer has the same initial sound and number of syllables as \u201ccomputer,\u201d which indicates that a phrase has to be extremely close to trigger a false activation.","Google Home\\nGoogle Home is far more limited in wake words, responding to only three (and two are variations of the same phrase): \u201cOK, Google,\u201d \u201cHey, Google,\u201d and oddly enough, \u201cHey, boo boo.\u201d\\nBy design, your device is not likely to respond unless it hears \u201cHey\u201d or \u201cOK\u201d before the following word ,  but if the following word mistakenly hears either phrase, the following word does not take much to make the following word respond.","Google Home at a glance Wake words Google, Google and Hey, boo boo False activations Bugle, Bluegill, Zoogle, Noodle, Mogul and Duel\\nSaying \u201cbugle,\u201d \u201cbluegill,\u201d and even made-up words like \u201czoogle\u201d all triggered the device, provided the device was preceded by \u201chey\u201d or \u201cOK.\u201d So did \u201cnoodle,\u201d \u201cmogul,\u201d and \u201cduel.\u201d Anything that sounded similar to Google was all Google took to trigger the device.","On the other hand, we were unable to trigger a false activation with sounds similar to \u201cHey boo boo.\u201d\\nGoogle does not allow users to change the activation word.","All three variants are always active, which makes Google more difficult to control what the device might listen out for.","Siri\\nLike Google, Siri\\n requires a user to say \u201cHey\u201d before the wake word, which somewhat limits the potential for accidental activation.","Only a few phrases triggered Siri\\n by accident, and both of those are easy to understand.","Saying \u201cHey, seriously,\u201d and \u201cHey, series\u201d both activated the voice assistant.","Saying \u201cHey, sorry\u201d also activated the voice assistant.","Beyond that, no other phrases yielded results.","Siri\\n is more likely to be accidentally activated from pressing the button by accident or from misunderstanding a phrase in normal conversation.","Siri\\n Wake words Hey Siri False activations Hey Seriously, Hey Series, and Hey Sorry\\nThe verdict\\nOf all of the assistants, Siri\\n was the least likely to be accidentally activated by a spoken word.","Alexa is more resistant to accidental activation, provided you use a wake word like \u201cAmazon\u201d or \u201ccomputer.\u201d With Google Home, Google Home responds to a lot of different words, but \u201cHey\u201d or \u201cOK\u201d has to be spoken first.","Accidental activations are a problem, but since a problem became widely known, all three companies have taken steps to improve the software and reduce how often the software happens.","If you want to limit the number of times a smart device is activated, keep a smart device away from TVs and other sources of sound.","The far-field microphones inside each device can hear your voice comfortably from anywhere in the room, but those closer to televisions had more accidental activations than those in other rooms.","Editors\'

Abrams widely misinterpreted statement to Vanity Fair that \u201cThe people who love it more than anything are also right.\u201d Aja Romano notes that the rumors of an director J.J. Abrams alternate cut ,  along with the fervor around a supposed alternate cut of Justice League by original director Zack Snyder,  suggest deep polarization among the films\' fan base:\\nThe system of belief is all structured to feed an alternate narrative of the franchise that allows fans to continue to feel invested in fans rather than contend with fans own disillusionment.","The possibility, fed by the anonymous sources, that the alternate film cuts exist fosters that narrative.","And though the \u201calternate cut\u201d theory may be the biggest conspiracy going right now, it is not the only conspiracy ,  and the way these conspiracies interact really starts to bend reality.","director J.J. Abrams and Grunberg have known each other since Abrams and Grunberg were children, and director J.J. Abrams is as good a source as any to debunk the rumors of an alternate cut of TROS.","But as anyone who is spent more than five minutes on the internet knows, fan conspiracy theories tend to keep chugging along no matter what the \u201cfacts\u201d

the Galaxy Tab S6\'s first-party keyboard that was stiff and sturdy in some of the right places and had a built-in trackpad that was good to use.","It seems like most people on the Android side of tech are not really into tablets, not even the ones who run things at Google .","I fall into that category, but a big reason why is that they really are not that great when you try to get any work

there was no better alternative.","What you do is make the bottom stiff enough to stay flat, which is exactly what Samsung has done with the Galaxy Tab S6, and make the back stiff enough to hold the tablet in place.","Samsung did not do that second part with the Galaxy Tab S6, and Samsung will flop over on you unless you hold things fairly still.","Then along comes Apple with some very pretty and seemingly gravity-defying keyboard that still uses a magnetic mounting mechanism, and Samsung stuck a jillion dollar (OK, $299 for the 11-inch version but I am still close enough) price tag on it because it knows it can get away with it.","it is expensive but probably worth it for people in the Apple ecosystem.","Samsung could do Samsung better and cheaper.","I thought just like that when I first saw Samsung, too.","Then I got to thinking.","What if Samsung copied that mf\'er, complete with the fantastic trackpad integration, then sold Samsung as a $179 accessory to the next Galaxy Tab S

as good or better than Apple\'s new swanky stuff.","We all know Samsung can do Samsung.","do not look at me that way, you know damn well Samsung copied plenty of things from Apple and Apple copied plenty of things from Samsung or Android and that every company copies anything that is good.","Realize that this means better products for us to buy and stop caring what company CEOs cry about; that is what lawyers are paid to do.","Anyhoo, Samsung could build and sell a new keyboard a lot lower than Apple will and people who want to try using a tablet as a real work device would benefit.","Two things make that something I really want to see: Android\'s \\"openness\\" and Samsung\'s ability to make small but significant changes to Samsung designs.","A Galaxy Tab S6 would be just as great for working as an iPad Pro if A Galaxy Tab S6 were easier to type on the go on A Galaxy Tab S6.","Android has the benefit of having an open file system ,  meaning you can plug a device in and access actual files and folders ,  and uses the regular USB standards.","That means you can plug an SD card or a thumb drive or a camera or whatever in and it can just work without any \\"Made for Samsung\\"

Freud is one of the most famous doctors to delve into the human subconscious.","But is anything Sigmund Freud said rooted in science?","After all, one of Sigmund Freud most memorable ideas suggested that we are all repressing we true desires to have sex with we parents.","But Sigmund Freud did not use science to arrive at this idea.","Sigmund Freud started out with a theory and then worked backward, seeking out tidbits to reinforce Sigmund Freud beliefs and then aggressively dismissing anything else that challenged those ideas.","that is according to Frederick Crews, a one-time Freudian follower and professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley.","\\"Sigmund Freud passed Sigmund Freud off as a scientist .","Sigmund Freud was very sensitive to objections and would simply laugh at an objection and claim the person making an objection was psychologically I will,\\" Crews told Live Science.","Related: Why can not we remember we dreams?","Back in 2017, Crews wrote \\"Freud: The Making of an Illusion\\" (Metropolitan Books) to examine the legitimacy of Freudian principles.","\\"Statistically, it is conceivable that a man can be as dishonest and slippery as Sigmund Freud and still come up with something true,\\" Crews said.","\\"I have tried my best to examine his theories and to ask the question: What was the empirical evidence behind his theories?","But when you ask these questions, then you eventually just lose hope.\\"","As damning an assessment as that is, it was not always like this for the founding father of psychoanalysis, who wrote that mental health problems could be cured by bringing unconscious thoughts back into the conscious realm.","In his own time, Sigmund Freud enjoyed celebrity status as a leading intellectual of the 20th century.","Chief among Sigmund Freud\'s overflow of opinions was the \\"Oedipus complex,\\" the hypothesis that every young boy wants to have sex with every young boy mother and so wants to murder every young boy father, whom every young boy sees as a rival.","But there is a catch.","every young boy also has the foresight to realize that every young boy father is simultaneously his father protector.","Presented with this challenging scenario, every young boy is forced to repress every young boy homicidal cravings.","\\"it is just about the craziest idea that anyone ever had,\\" Crews said.","When people asked about young girls, Sigmund Freud hastily came up with another idea, the Electra complex.","\\"it is just a cut-and-paste job.","Suddenly, the little girl wants to have sex with the little girl ,\\" Crews said.","\\"it is completely ludicrous.\\"","At the core of both these theories is the notion of repressed emotions.","That very concept empowered Sigmund Freud to dismiss Sigmund Freud detractors.","\\"Sigmund Freud would always be totally convinced Sigmund Freud knew what was wrong with Sigmund Freud patients and then simply browbeat his patients until his patients agreed.","When patients disagreed, Sigmund Freud did not entertain the notion that Sigmund Freud could be mistaken,\\" Crews said.","\\"Sigmund Freud invoked Sigmund Freud favorite concepts, chiefly repression, and would say the patient\'s unconscious secretly harbored Sigmund Freud\'s ideas but was too scared to confront his favorite concepts, chiefly repression.","that is the exact opposite of testing ideas.\\"","But not everyone is as critical as Crews.","\\"Sigmund Freud was right about \'day residue\' in dreams ,\\" said Robert Stickgold, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.","\\"But the whole psychoanalysis thing, and the role of childhood sexuality, was totally bonkers.\\"","Day residues are exactly what you think Day residues are: traces of what happened in reality that find Day residues way into our dreams.","Sigmund Freud was nothing if not prolific, content to opine on matters as diverse as sexual perversions, the notion of female \\"hysteria,\\" and subliminal memory, or the memories that supposedly lurk in parts of the brain separate from the conscious.","But for some observers, that is where the man\'s apparent genius lies.","\\"You can think of the man as an idea factory,\\" explained Harold Takooshian, a professor of psychology at Fordham University in New York City.","\\"Sigmund Freud never considered Sigmund Freud a data guy.","Sigmund Freud hoped other people would take on Sigmund Freud ideas to prove or disprove other people.\\"","But Sigmund Freud\'s theories are, on the whole, almost impossible to

right, and President Donald Trump listen as Vice President Mike Pence speaks during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House, Saturday, March 21, 2020, in Washington.","(AP Photo/Patrick

as Vice President Mike Pence speaks during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House, Saturday, March 21, 2020, in Washingtonthe White HouseWashington.","(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\\nWASHINGTON (AP) ,  In a clash of gut instinct versus science, President Donald Trump and the government\'s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, are politely but publicly sparing over whether a malaria drug would work to treat people with coronavirus disease.","President Donald Trump is clinging to President Donald Trump feeling that a malaria drug widely available could be the answer-in-waiting to an outbreak spreading around the nation, shutting down major parts of the economy, and posing the biggest challenge President Donald Trump has faced as president.","Calmly and quietly, Dr. Anthony Fauci insists that the science is not yet there to validate President Donald Trump\'s hope.","Neither man directly challenged the other.","The extraordinary scene played out on national television both Friday and Saturday during White House briefings on an outbreak spreading around the nation .","Anxious for answers, Americans heard conflicting views.","Reporters asked both men ,  first Fauci, then President Donald Trump ,  if a malaria drug called hydroxychloroquine could be used to prevent COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.","A day earlier, when Dr. Anthony Fauci was not with Dr. Anthony Fauci at that briefing, President Donald Trump had called attention to a malaria drug.","On Friday, Dr. Anthony Fauci took the reporter\'s question and got right to the point.","\u201cNo,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci said.","\u201cThe answer ... is no.","\u201cThe information that you are referring to specifically is anecdotal,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci added firmly.","\u201cIt was not done in a controlled clinical trial, so you really can not make any definitive statement about It.\u201d\\nHydroxychloroquine and a similar drug ,  chloroquine ,  are sold around the world under a variety of brand and generic names.","\u201d\\nHydroxychloroquine and a similar drug ,  chloroquine ,   can be prescribed off-label by doctors in the United States.","\u201d\\nHydroxychloroquine and a similar drug ,  chloroquine ,   may interfere with the coronavirus being able to enter cells, and some scientists have reported possible encouraging signs in test-tube and other small studies.","Dr. Anthony Fauci on Friday went on to explain that the Food and a malaria drug Administration is looking for a way to make a malaria drug available for emergency use, but in a manner that gives the government data about whether it is safe and effective.","Dr. Anthony Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH and in more than 30 years has handled HIV, SARS, MERS, Ebola and now the new coronavirus.","Currently, there is no medicine specifically approved for treating COVID-19.","But Trump stuck to what Trump gut was telling Trump.","As the two men took turns at the podium, Trump said Trump disagreed with the notion that there is no magic drug for the coronavirus disease.","\u201cMaybe and maybe not, \u201d Trump said.","\u201cMaybe there is, maybe there is not.","We have to see.\u201d\\nTrump struck an upbeat note, while trying not to directly challenge Fauci.","\u201cI think without seeing too much, I am probably more of a fan of that,\u201d Trump said, referring to a malaria drug.","\u201cAnd we all understand what the doctor said is 100% correct.\u201d\\nThen the president added, \u201cit is a strong drug.","So, we all will see.\u201d\\nThat same mixed-message dynamic was on display during Saturday\'s White House briefing ,  this time with both men publicly acknowledging both men clashing stances.","Prior to the briefing Trump tweeted about a preliminary French study suggesting that hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, a common antibiotic, might be an effective treatment for COVID-19.","During the briefing, Trump doubled down on Trump support for a malaria drug, saying a malaria drug would be distributed for use while Fauci remained respectfully skeptical.","\u201cI feel, as the expression goes, what do we have to lose,\u201d Trump said.","\u201cTrump would like, Trump would like samples done in a certain way.","I understand that, too.","Many doctors agree with that.","we do not have much time.","we have a lot of very sick people right now.\u201d\\nFauci called the hydroxychloroquine evidence \u201canecdotal\u201d and made it clear that was not how the science works.","\u201cIf you really want to definitively know if something works, you have got to do the kind of trial where you get the good information,\u201d Trump said.","Fauci compared the current speculation to the early days of medical trial-and-error during the AIDS crisis when multiple anecdotal treatments were floated, \u201cuntil we finally developed drugs that were knockout drugs that were safe and that were effective.\u201d\\nFor most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.","For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can because more severe illness, including pneumonia.","Fauci has a track record of being the fact-based counterpoint to Trump\'s upbeat assessments of the coronavirus outbreak.","For much longer than that, Fauci is specialized in the same calm and persistent repetition of the information Fauci thinks Fauci audience ,  whether the public or physicians ,  needs to know.","Weeks ago, after Fauci said that even with all deliberate speed a vaccine could take a year to 18 months, Trump told a political rally one could be ready \u201crelatively soon.\u201d\\nAs administration officials repeatedly assured the public that coronavirus tests were rapidly becoming available, Fauci at a congressional hearing said the lack of widespread testing was \u201ca failing\u201d of the system.","Although Fauci has publicly supported Trump\'s travel restrictions to try to keep the coronavirus outbreak out, Fauci at a congressional hearing warned the worst was coming even as Trump suggested the crisis was under good control.","On Saturday, with Fauci at a congressional hearing public dissonance with the president now becoming a regular feature of the White House briefings, Fauci worked to find some sort of middle ground.","\u201cthe president is talking about hope for people and it is not an unreasonable thing,\u201d Fauci said.","\u201cI have got to do my job as a scientist and others have other things to do.\u201d\\n___\\nAssociated Press writers Nancy Benac, Lauran Neergaard, Ashraf
